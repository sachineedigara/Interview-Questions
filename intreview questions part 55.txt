Tell Me About Yourself

Introduction: Provide a concise overview of your professional background, highlighting your experience in DevOps, cloud technologies, and any specific projects or accomplishments relevant to the role.
What Are Your Day-to-Day Activities?

Day-to-Day Activities: Describe your typical tasks and responsibilities, such as managing CI/CD pipelines, deploying applications, monitoring infrastructure, troubleshooting issues, and collaborating with development and operations teams.
Do You Have Experience in Writing CI/CD Pipelines?

CI/CD Pipelines Experience: Discuss your experience in designing, implementing, and managing CI/CD pipelines. Mention tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions, and provide examples of pipelines you’ve created.
Scripted or Declarative Pipeline? Explain the Stages

Scripted vs Declarative Pipeline:
Scripted Pipeline: Written in Groovy, offering more flexibility but can be complex. Stages are defined programmatically.
Declarative Pipeline: Provides a simpler syntax using a structured format. Stages are defined using a declarative syntax.
Stages: Common stages include Build, Test, Deploy, and Post (for cleanup).
Do You Work on All the Stages or on Any Particular Stages?

Pipeline Stages: Explain your involvement in various stages of the CI/CD pipeline, such as building, testing, deploying, or monitoring. Mention any specific stages you focus on or manage end-to-end.
Explain How You Build the Docker Image with the Help of Pipeline and Share the Screen and Write the Stage

Building Docker Image in Pipeline:
groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Docker Image') {
      steps {
        script {
          docker.build('my-image')
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Explanation: This stage defines a pipeline that uses a Docker agent to build an image named my-image.
Do You Have Any Scripting Knowledge?

Scripting Knowledge: Discuss your experience with scripting languages like Bash, Python, or PowerShell. Mention tasks you’ve automated and any notable scripts you’ve written.
How Can You Rate Yourself in That?

Self-Rating: Provide a self-assessment of your scripting skills, including specific projects or tasks that demonstrate your proficiency.
Explain Why We Use Kubernetes Compared to Docker Swarm?

Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm:
Kubernetes: Offers more advanced features for orchestration, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Provides a robust ecosystem, including Helm charts and a large community.
Docker Swarm: Simpler setup, less feature-rich compared to Kubernetes, suitable for smaller or less complex deployments.
What All AWS Services Have You Used?

AWS Services: List the AWS services you’ve worked with, such as EC2, S3, RDS, EKS, Lambda, and CloudFormation, and describe your experience with each.
Explain How to Write a Dockerfile

Dockerfile Explanation:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official base image
FROM nginx:latest
# Copy files into the container
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
# Expose port
EXPOSE 80
# Define default command
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Explanation: This Dockerfile uses the Nginx base image, copies the application files, exposes port 80, and defines the default command to run Nginx.
What Are the Basic Commands in Git?

Basic Git Commands:
git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone <repo-url>: Clone a repository.
git add <file>: Add file changes to the staging area.
git commit -m "message": Commit changes with a message.
git push: Push changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Pull changes from a remote repository.
What Is the Major Difference Between Git Merge and Rebase?

Git Merge vs Rebase:
Merge: Combines changes from different branches, creating a merge commit. Preserves history.
Rebase: Applies changes from one branch onto another, rewriting history. Creates a linear history but can complicate history if used improperly.
What Are the Types of Deployments in Kubernetes?

Types of Deployments:
Rolling Update: Updates Pods incrementally without downtime.
Recreate: Terminates existing Pods and creates new ones.
Blue-Green Deployment: Deploys a new version alongside the old one and switches traffic once the new version is validated.
Canary Release: Releases changes to a subset of users before a full rollout.
Why Are You Using RollingUpdate?

Rolling Update: Provides a strategy for updating applications with minimal or no downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.
What Are the Basic Docker Commands You Have Used?

Basic Docker Commands:
docker run: Run a container from an image.
docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
docker ps: List running containers.
docker stop <container-id>: Stop a running container.
docker images: List available images.
Why Are You Using Terraform?

Terraform: A tool for infrastructure-as-code that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It helps with managing and versioning infrastructure.
Do You Know How to Write a Playbook?

Ansible Playbook:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Install and start nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Start nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
Explanation: This playbook installs and starts the Nginx web server on specified hosts.
