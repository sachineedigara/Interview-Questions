Roles and Responsibilities in Your Job

[Your roles and responsibilities]: Describe your core responsibilities, such as managing CI/CD pipelines, deploying and scaling applications, automating processes, ensuring system reliability, and collaborating with development teams.
Types of Services in Kubernetes

ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
NodePort: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
ExternalName: Maps the service to a DNS name.
Explain About Ingress

Ingress: Manages external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS. It provides a way to define rules for routing traffic to different services based on request properties like hostname and URL path.
Explain About Autoscaling Groups

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): Automatically scales the number of EC2 instances in response to demand. You can configure ASGs to maintain a desired number of instances, adjust based on CloudWatch metrics, and replace unhealthy instances.
Explain About StatefulSet

StatefulSet: Manages stateful applications and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pods. Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets maintain a sticky identity for each pod and ensure stable network identities and persistent storage.
Explain About DaemonSet

DaemonSet: Ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all (or some) nodes in the cluster. It is used for running background processes like log collection or monitoring agents on every node.
What is Node Selector and How to Use It

Node Selector: A field in the pod spec that restricts pods to run only on nodes with specific labels. It is used to control pod placement.
yaml
Copy code
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
If Pods in the Deployment Are Not Deployed, How to Troubleshoot

Troubleshooting Steps:
Check the pod status with kubectl get pods.
Inspect pod events with kubectl describe pod <pod-name>.
Review logs with kubectl logs <pod-name>.
Check deployment status with kubectl get deployments and kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>.
Have You Created Helm Charts?

[Your experience with Helm charts]: Explain your experience creating Helm charts, including defining templates, values, and deploying applications using Helm.
How to Connect to or Set Up a Cluster After It's Created

Connecting to a Cluster: Use kubectl and configure the kubeconfig file. Example:
bash
Copy code
kubectl config set-cluster <cluster-name> --server=<api-server-url>
kubectl config set-credentials <user> --token=<token>
kubectl config set-context <context-name> --cluster=<cluster-name> --user=<user>
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
How to Use Vaults in Kubernetes

Vault Integration: Use Kubernetes Secrets and Vault to manage secrets. Configure Vault to provide secrets and use Kubernetes authentication methods to access them. Example with Vault Agent Injector:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-app
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vault-secrets
      mountPath: /vault/secrets
  volumes:
  - name: vault-secrets
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: vault-token
      - configMap:
          name: vault-config
Difference Between PV and PVC

PersistentVolume (PV): Represents a piece of storage in the cluster, provisioned by an administrator or dynamically.
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): A request for storage by a user. It binds to a PV based on the requested size and access modes.
How to Downgrade a Helm Application

Downgrading: Use the helm rollback command to revert to a previous revision.
bash
Copy code
helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>
How to Check the Difference Between Two Helm Versions

Diff Command: Use helm diff plugin to compare two versions of a Helm release.
bash
Copy code
helm diff upgrade <release-name> <chart> --version <new-version> --dry-run
What is VPC and Its Components

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A virtual network within AWS. Components include:
Subnets: Segments of a VPC’s IP address range.
Route Tables: Control traffic routing within the VPC.
Internet Gateway: Enables communication with the internet.
NAT Gateway: Allows private subnet instances to access the internet.
If I Have Two Applications in Two Different VPCs, How Can I Connect Them?

VPC Peering: Establish a peering connection between VPCs.
Transit Gateway: Use AWS Transit Gateway to interconnect multiple VPCs.
Difference Between Roles and Policies

Roles: AWS IAM entities that define a set of permissions and can be assumed by users or services.
Policies: Documents that define permissions, which can be attached to roles, users, or groups.
How Can We Connect Two AWS Accounts in Which One I Have a Service and the Other I Have an Application

Cross-Account Access: Use IAM roles to grant permissions to resources in one AWS account from another. Set up a trust relationship between the accounts and configure necessary permissions.
What Are the Resources You Created in Terraform

[Your resources]: Describe the types of resources you have created with Terraform, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, RDS databases, etc.
Where You Stored Your State File

State File Storage: Store Terraform state files in a remote backend like AWS S3 with state locking via DynamoDB or other supported backends.
What All Will Be There in the State File

State File Contents: Includes resource metadata, resource IDs, and the current state of managed resources. It allows Terraform to track resource changes.
Have You Worked on Flux and ArgoCD?

[Your experience with Flux and ArgoCD]: Explain how you’ve used these tools for GitOps, including setting up automated deployments and managing Kubernetes resources.
How to Push Files from Local to Remote Repo to Master Branch, Give Me Entire Commands

Commands:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin master
What is git status and What is the Difference Between git diff and git status

git status: Shows the status of working directory and staging area, including changes staged for commit.
git diff: Displays changes between the working directory and the index (staging area) or between commits.
What is Helm Lint

Helm Lint: A command used to check Helm charts for common issues and adherence to best practices. Example:
bash
Copy code
helm lint <chart-directory>
How to Connect to the Private Subnet

Private Subnet Access: Use a VPN or Direct Connect to access instances in a private subnet from your network. Alternatively, use a bastion host or jump box.
How to Roll Out in Kubernetes

Rolling Update: Use kubectl rollout commands to manage updates to deployments.
bash
Copy code
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>
Feel free to adjust these responses based on your actual experience and specific role.
