Introduction

I am a DevOps professional with extensive experience in managing and automating infrastructure, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and working with containerization and orchestration tools. I have a strong background in AWS services, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible. In my current role, I ensure seamless application deployments and maintain a highly available and scalable infrastructure.
Total years of experience, education details

I have X years of experience in DevOps and cloud engineering. I hold a [Your Degree] in [Your Major] from [Your University].
Share the screen and write a sample multistage Dockerfile

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM maven:3.6.3-jdk-8 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY src /app/src
COPY pom.xml /app
RUN mvn -f /app/pom.xml clean package

# Stage 2: Run the application
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/myapp.jar"]
Write the command to build the Docker image and push the image to Docker Hub

sh
Copy code
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t myusername/myapp:latest .

# Log in to Docker Hub
docker login --username myusername --password mypassword

# Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
docker push myusername/myapp:latest
How will you create the container

sh
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name myapp-container myusername/myapp:latest
Write a stage to perform Docker login

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('docker-hub-credentials-id')
  }
  stages {
    stage('Login to Docker Hub') {
      steps {
        script {
          docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS) {
            echo 'Logged in to Docker Hub'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
What technologies you build and deploy?

Technologies include Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Jenkins for CI/CD, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and AWS services for cloud infrastructure.
What is the technology you used to store data?

Technologies used include AWS RDS for relational databases, DynamoDB for NoSQL, and S3 for object storage.
If you want to connect to a database, what information is required?

Database hostname or IP address
Port number
Database name
Username and password
Connection protocol (e.g., JDBC, ODBC)
Difference between git clone and git pull

git clone: Copies an entire repository to a new directory.
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
What is the pull request process?

Developers create a feature branch and make changes.
A pull request (PR) is created to merge changes into the main branch.
Code reviews are performed, and feedback is provided.
Once approved, the PR is merged, and the branch is typically deleted.
How will you add secrets in K8s?

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
Use kubectl create secret to add secrets from the command line.
What is the difference between COPY and ADD?

COPY: Copies files/directories from the host to the container.
ADD: Copies files/directories and can also extract compressed files and download remote files.
What is the difference between RUN and CMD?

RUN: Executes commands to build the image (used in the Dockerfile's build stage).
CMD: Specifies the command to run when the container starts (runtime stage).
What is nodeSelector in K8s? How does it work?

nodeSelector is used to constrain a pod to only be scheduled on nodes with specific labels. It works by specifying the label selector in the pod's specification.
yaml
Copy code
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
What are liveness and readiness probes in Kubernetes?

Liveness Probe: Checks if a container is running. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
Readiness Probe: Checks if a container is ready to accept traffic. If the readiness probe fails, the container is removed from service endpoints.
yaml
Copy code
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 3
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 3
Write some example script in Linux.

Example Bash script to monitor a service:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

SERVICE="nginx"

if pgrep -x "$SERVICE" >/dev/null
then
    echo "$SERVICE is running"
else
    echo "$SERVICE is not running"
fi
Jenkins is not working in Linux machine. How will you troubleshoot?

Check the Jenkins service status: systemctl status jenkins
Review Jenkins logs located at /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
Verify system resources (CPU, memory)
Check network connectivity
Restart the Jenkins service: systemctl restart jenkins
What are the types of EC2 instances in AWS?

General Purpose (e.g., T3, M5)
Compute Optimized (e.g., C5)
Memory Optimized (e.g., R5)
Storage Optimized (e.g., I3)
GPU Instances (e.g., P3)
What are the types of storages in AWS?

S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier, Storage Gateway
What is the difference between EBS and EFS?

EBS: Block storage, single instance attachment, suitable for databases and applications.
EFS: File storage, multiple instance attachments, scalable, suitable for file sharing and big data.
What are S3 storage classes in AWS?

Standard: General-purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between two access tiers.
Standard-IA: Infrequently accessed data, lower cost, retrieval fee.
One Zone-IA: Infrequently accessed data in a single AZ, lower cost.
Glacier: Low-cost storage for archival, retrieval time in minutes to hours.
Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest-cost storage, retrieval time in hours.
What is S3 lifecycle policy?

S3 lifecycle policies allow you to define actions (transition or expiration) for objects based on their age, enabling automated tiering and cleanup of objects.
json
Copy code
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "Transition to Glacier",
      "Prefix": "",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Can you explain the Terraform workflow?

Write: Define infrastructure as code in .tf files.
Plan: Generate an execution plan with terraform plan.
Apply: Execute the plan with terraform apply.
Destroy: Remove infrastructure with terraform destroy.
How do you secure the state file?

Use remote state backends like S3 with encryption, enable state locking, and limit access via IAM policies.
