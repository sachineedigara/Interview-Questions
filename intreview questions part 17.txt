CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring that software can be released reliably at any time.

Typical Stages in CI/CD Pipeline:

Source Code Management: Integrating with version control systems like Git.
Build: Compiling the code, creating build artifacts.
Test: Running unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests.
Deploy: Deploying to various environments (dev, staging, prod).
Monitor: Monitoring the application and infrastructure post-deployment.
Challenges in CI/CD Pipeline:

Complexity: Managing and automating the entire pipeline can be complex, especially with microservices.
Environment Parity: Ensuring consistency across different environments (dev, staging, prod).
Test Reliability: Maintaining reliable and fast tests to prevent false positives/negatives.
Security: Integrating security checks and compliance in the pipeline.
Rollback: Implementing effective rollback strategies in case of failures.
Scalability: Ensuring the pipeline can scale with the team and project growth.
EBS and EFS
EBS (Elastic Block Store):

Usage: Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
Features: Persistent storage, snapshots, various volume types (SSD, HDD), encryption.
Performance: Designed for applications requiring single-instance storage with high throughput and low latency.
EFS (Elastic File System):

Usage: Provides scalable file storage for use with AWS services and on-premises resources.
Features: Fully managed, scalable, POSIX-compliant file system, accessible from multiple EC2 instances.
Performance: Suitable for workloads that require shared file access and throughput.
Branching Strategy
Branching Strategy:

Main Branch: The primary branch where the production-ready code resides.
Feature Branch: Created for new features, isolated from the main branch until complete.
Develop Branch: Integrates changes from feature branches before merging into the main branch.
Release Branch: Used to prepare for a new production release.
Hotfix Branch: Created for urgent fixes that need to be applied to production quickly.
Hotfix Branch Example:

Create Hotfix Branch: From the main branch for a critical bug fix.
sh
Copy code
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-123 main
Fix the Issue: Apply and commit the fix.
sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Fix critical issue #123"
Merge to Main: Merge the hotfix branch back to the main branch.
sh
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/issue-123
Deploy: Deploy the updated main branch to production.
Merge to Develop: Ensure the hotfix is also merged into the develop branch.
sh
Copy code
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/issue-123
Terraform State File
State File:

Usage: Tracks the state of infrastructure managed by Terraform.
Configuration:
hcl
Copy code
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "path/to/my/key"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
Purpose: Maintains the mapping of real-world resources to Terraform configuration, enabling consistent management and updates.
State Locking:

Purpose: Prevents concurrent operations from modifying the state file.
Implementation: Typically achieved using a locking mechanism like DynamoDB when using remote state storage.
Kubernetes Components
Kubernetes Components:

Master Node Components:
API Server: Front-end for the Kubernetes control plane.
etcd: Key-value store for cluster data.
Scheduler: Assigns nodes to newly created pods.
Controller Manager: Manages controllers that handle routine tasks.
Worker Node Components:
Kubelet: Ensures containers are running.
Kube-Proxy: Handles networking for the pods.
Container Runtime: Software that runs the containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
Terraform to Create an EC2 Instance and Assign Elastic IP
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_eip" "example_eip" {
  instance = aws_instance.example.id
}
Kubernetes Cluster Architecture
Cluster Architecture:

Control Plane: Manages the overall state of the cluster (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager).
Worker Nodes: Run the applications (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).
Networking: Uses CNI plugins for pod networking, service networking, and ingress controllers.
High Traffic Pod Scaling
Pod Auto-Scaling:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU utilization or other select metrics.
Metrics Server: Collects resource metrics from nodes.
HPA Configuration:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
Optimizing Docker Images for Size
Optimizing Docker Images:

Multi-Stage Builds: Separate build and runtime stages to reduce the final image size.
Minimal Base Images: Use smaller base images like alpine.
Remove Unnecessary Files: Delete temporary files and caches during the build process.
User URL Navigation to Pod/Container
Flow:

User Hits URL: User request is sent to a DNS service (e.g., Route 53).
Ingress Controller: Directs the request to the appropriate service within the cluster.
Service: Load balancer distributes the request to one of the pods.
Pod/Container: Processes the request and sends the response back to the user.
Kubernetes Load Balancer
Kubernetes Load Balancer:

Type: LoadBalancer service type automatically provisions an external load balancer.
Function: Distributes incoming traffic to the pods in a service.
Init Container
Init Container:

Purpose: Runs before the main application container starts.
Use Case: Used for tasks like setting up environment variables, configuration, or dependencies that need to be completed before the application starts.
Checking CrashLoopBackOff Error
Troubleshooting CrashLoopBackOff:

Check Pod Status: kubectl get pods
Describe Pod: kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Logs: kubectl logs <pod-name>
Events: kubectl get events
Configuration: Verify YAML/Helm chart configurations for issues.
