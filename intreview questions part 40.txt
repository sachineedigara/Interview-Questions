 Introduce Yourself
Start with a brief summary of your background and experience.
Mention the tools and technologies you have worked with.
Highlight your experience with various companies, focusing on your role and achievements.
Discuss any significant automations or projects you've worked on.
2. Have You Worked on Any Other Cloud Platforms?
Yes, I have worked with multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
For each platform, mention key services you've used and any relevant projects or tasks.
3. Difference Between NACL and Security Group
Network ACL (NACL): Operates at the subnet level. It is stateless, meaning both inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately. Used for controlling traffic between subnets.
Security Group: Operates at the instance level. It is stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic, outbound traffic is automatically allowed. Used for controlling traffic to/from instances.
4. How to Connect to a DB in a Private Subnet?
Use a bastion host or jump box in a public subnet to connect to the private subnet.
Alternatively, use a VPN or Direct Connect if accessing from an external network.
Ensure proper security group and network ACL configurations to allow traffic between the application and the database.
5. Explain IAM
Identity and Access Management (IAM): A service in AWS for managing access to AWS resources.
Roles: Define a set of permissions that can be assumed by entities like users or services.
Policies: JSON documents that define permissions.
Users: Individuals or systems that need access.
Groups: Collections of users with similar permissions.
6. If I Have a Requirement to Have Users with Similar Permissions, Should I Create Individual Policies?
No, you should create a policy and attach it to a group. Assign users to the group rather than creating individual policies for each user. This makes management easier and more consistent.
7. If You Have an Application, How Do You Make It Highly Available?
Deploy the application across multiple availability zones (AZs) or regions.
Use load balancers to distribute traffic.
Implement auto-scaling to handle varying loads.
Ensure redundancy at every level (database, compute, etc.).
8. How Can We Secure Our Application from Incoming Traffic with Unauthorized Requests?
Use security groups and NACLs to control inbound traffic.
Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to filter and monitor HTTP requests.
Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Regularly update and patch your application.
9. Explain Autoscaling and Its Types
Horizontal Scaling: Adding or removing instances based on load (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling).
Vertical Scaling: Increasing or decreasing the resources (CPU, memory) of a single instance.
Dynamic Scaling: Automatically adjusts based on predefined policies or metrics.
Scheduled Scaling: Adjusts resources based on a schedule.
10. Explain VPC Peering and VPC Gateways
VPC Peering: Connects two VPCs to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. Useful for inter-VPC communication.
VPC Gateway: Refers to various types of gateways such as Internet Gateway (for public access), NAT Gateway (for private subnet access), and Virtual Private Gateway (for VPN connections).
11. Have You Worked on Terraform? What Is the Difference Between Providers and Provisioners?
Providers: Plugins that enable Terraform to interact with cloud providers and services (e.g., AWS, Azure). They define how resources are managed.
Provisioners: Used to execute scripts or commands on resources after they are created. Useful for configuration management but should be used sparingly as they are not ideal for managing resources.
12. If We Have Different Environments, Do We Have to Write Different Configuration Files for Each?
It is common to use separate configuration files or directories for each environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod). This helps manage environment-specific settings and reduce the risk of cross-environment issues.
13. If I Have a Script I Have to Run on Existing Resources, How Can I Do It in Terraform?
Use terraform provisioner or local-exec to run scripts on existing resources. Alternatively, use configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet integrated with Terraform.
14. How Will You Add Manually Created Resources to Terraform?
Import the manually created resources into Terraform state using the terraform import command. Define the resources in your configuration files to ensure Terraform manages them moving forward.
15. Explain CI-CD in Jenkins
Continuous Integration (CI): Automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently. Jenkins can build and test code changes automatically.
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Automates the process of deploying code changes to production or staging environments. Jenkins pipelines define the steps for build, test, and deploy.
16. You Have Two Jenkins Files in Different Branches in Your Multi-Branch Pipeline. How Can You Use the Output of One Pipeline Within Another?
Use Jenkins' ability to access build artifacts or outputs. You can archive artifacts in one pipeline and retrieve them in another pipeline using Jenkins' artifact repository or storage solutions.
17. How Will You Pull a Docker Image to Your Pipeline?
Use the docker command or Docker plugins in Jenkins to pull images. Define a step in your Jenkinsfile to pull the Docker image from a repository (e.g., docker pull <image-name>).
18. What Are the Types of Pipeline Scripts?
Declarative Pipeline: Uses a structured format for defining pipelines with a more readable syntax. Recommended for most use cases.
Scripted Pipeline: Uses a more flexible, code-centric approach. Suitable for complex scenarios requiring more control.
19. Have You Worked on Cost Optimization?
Yes, I have worked on cost optimization by right-sizing instances, using reserved instances or savings plans, and optimizing resource utilization. Regularly review and analyze cloud usage and billing reports.
20. Have You Worked on Prometheus and Grafana?
Yes, I have experience with both tools. They are commonly used for monitoring and visualization.
21. Explain About the Setup of Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus: Set up by configuring prometheus.yml with scrape configurations to collect metrics from various sources. Deploy using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly on a server.
Grafana: Set up by adding Prometheus as a data source and creating dashboards to visualize the collected metrics. Deploy using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly on a server.
22. Explain About Dashboards in Grafana
Dashboards: Grafana dashboards are customizable views that present data from various sources in a graphical format (graphs, charts, tables). They allow users to visualize and analyze data trends and metrics effectively. You can create dashboards by defining panels and queries to display specific metrics.
