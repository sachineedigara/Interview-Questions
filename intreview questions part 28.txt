General Questions
1. What are your roles and responsibilities?

My roles and responsibilities involve managing infrastructure, developing CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and troubleshooting applications, ensuring security compliance, and leading a team of DevOps professionals. This includes working with cloud services, container orchestration, automation, and infrastructure as code.
2. Explain the CI/CD process step by step.

Continuous Integration (CI):
Code Commit: Developers commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
Build: Automated build process is triggered to compile the code.
Test: Automated tests are run to verify code quality and functionality.
Package: The application is packaged into deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
Continuous Deployment (CD):
Deploy: Automated deployment process deploys the application to a staging or production environment.
Monitor: Application performance and logs are monitored.
Feedback: Issues are identified, and feedback is provided to developers for further improvements.
3. Branching Strategy

Git Flow: Uses branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
GitHub Flow: Simplified model with a main branch and feature branches.
GitLab Flow: Combines feature branches and environment branches.
Trunk-Based Development: Developers work on a single branch with frequent commits.
4. Which tool do you use for logging information in Kubernetes?

Common tools include Fluentd, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Grafana Loki.
5. How are you segregating the environment (e.g., dev, QA, prod)?

By using different namespaces, environments, or Kubernetes contexts. Each environment has its own configuration files, deployment pipelines, and access controls.
6. In a pipeline, after CI, is there any approval required for deployment?

Yes, it can be configured to require manual approval before deploying to production or sensitive environments.
7. Explain the process involved in migration from on-premises to AWS.

Assessment: Evaluate current infrastructure and dependencies.
Planning: Design the AWS architecture and migration strategy.
Preparation: Set up AWS environment and tools.
Migration: Use services like AWS Migration Hub, DMS, or third-party tools to move data and applications.
Testing: Validate that applications and data are functioning correctly.
Cutover: Transition to AWS and decommission on-premises systems.
Optimization: Monitor and optimize the new environment.
8. Have you worked on Route 53? Why is it called Route 53, and not Route 54 or 55?

Yes, Amazon Route 53 is a scalable DNS service. It's named "53" because it is a reference to the standard DNS port number (53).
9. What is an MX record? When do you use an A record and CNAME record?

MX (Mail Exchange) Record: Directs email to the correct mail server.
A Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
CNAME Record: Maps a domain to another domain name, useful for aliasing.
10. I have 2 EC2 instances running, with an ALB before that. Which record do you use to map your request to EC2 instances?

A Record or ALIAS Record is used to map the domain name to the ALB, which then directs traffic to the EC2 instances.
11. Explain about Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

Auto Scaling Group: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. It scales in or out based on policies and metrics such as CPU utilization or request count.
12. When you increase EC2 instances from 5 to 10 due to traffic, how does ASG know to increase the number of instances?

Scaling Policies are defined to trigger the scaling action based on metrics (e.g., CPU usage). ASG monitors these metrics and performs scaling actions according to the policy.
13. What happens to the data when you stop and then start an EC2 instance after 2 days?

Instance Store Volumes: Data is lost.
EBS Volumes: Data persists, as EBS volumes are independent of the instance lifecycle.
14. When to use ALB and NLB?

ALB (Application Load Balancer): Layer 7 load balancing for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
NLB (Network Load Balancer): Layer 4 load balancing for TCP/UDP traffic.
15. What is a sidecar?

Sidecar Container: A container running alongside the main application container in a pod to provide auxiliary functions (e.g., logging, monitoring).
16. If there is an issue with the application, and the manager asks for logs from 100s of pods, how do you handle this?

Centralized Logging Solution: Use tools like Fluentd, ELK Stack, or Grafana Loki to aggregate logs. Query the logs from the centralized system and provide them to the manager.
17. If you have 5 master nodes and 10 worker nodes, what happens if a master node crashes?

The cluster continues to function as long as there are remaining master nodes. Applications running on worker nodes remain operational.
18. What are private modules in Terraform?

Private Modules: Terraform modules that are stored in private repositories or Terraform private module registries.
19. What is state locking in Terraform?

State Locking: Ensures that only one person or process can modify the Terraform state at a time to avoid conflicts.
20. If you execute terraform apply on a configuration file with no resources, what happens?

Terraform will confirm that no changes are needed and will report that there is nothing to apply.
21. If resources were created earlier using a Terraform configuration file, and you modify the configuration file and run terraform apply, what happens?

Terraform will update the resources to match the new configuration.
22. Write a sample Dockerfile.

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
23. Write a Deployment YAML file.

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
24. Write a Jenkinsfile to login to Docker registry and push an image.

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build('my-image')
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Login') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://my-registry', 'my-credentials-id') {
                        docker.image('my-image').push('latest')
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
25. Jenkins server is not running. How do you fix it? What Linux commands do you use?

Check Status: systemctl status jenkins
Start Jenkins: systemctl start jenkins
Restart Jenkins: systemctl restart jenkins
Check Logs: journalctl -u jenkins
Additional Questions
1. Git stash?

Git Stash: Temporarily saves changes in your working directory that are not ready to be committed.
2. Difference between git pull and git clone?

Git Pull: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into your local branch.
Git Clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
3. Explain the process of a Pull Request (PR).

Create PR: Developer pushes a branch to a remote repository and creates a pull request.
Review: Other team members review the code changes.
Merge: Once approved, the PR is merged into the target branch.
4. Difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile.

ADD: Can copy files from URL and extract archives.
COPY: Only copies files or directories from the build context to the container.
5. How will you create a secret in Kubernetes?

Use the kubectl create secret command or define a secret in a YAML file and apply it.
6. What is nodeSelector in Kubernetes?

nodeSelector: A field in a pod spec to constrain the pod
