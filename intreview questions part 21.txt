Relanto: Detailed Responses
1. Managing Disaster Recovery in AWS S3
To manage disaster recovery for AWS S3, you can use several strategies:

Versioning: Enable versioning on your S3 bucket to keep multiple versions of an object. This helps in recovering from accidental deletions or overwrites.
Cross-Region Replication (CRR): Set up CRR to automatically replicate objects to a bucket in a different AWS region, ensuring data redundancy across geographical locations.
Lifecycle Policies: Configure lifecycle policies to move older versions of objects to cheaper storage classes or to delete them after a certain period.
Backup and Restore: Regularly backup data to another S3 bucket or another storage service, and have a tested process for restoring data when needed.
2. Permanent Solution if S3 Bucket Storage is Full
Storage Classes: Move data to different storage classes like S3 Glacier or S3 Intelligent-Tiering to optimize costs for infrequently accessed data.
Lifecycle Policies: Implement lifecycle policies to transition objects to cheaper storage or to delete them after a specified period.
Data Archiving: Archive old and rarely accessed data to storage solutions like AWS Glacier.
Data Cleanup: Regularly clean up unnecessary files and old versions to free up space.
3. Creating VPC
Isolation: VPC allows you to isolate your resources within a virtual network.
Security: Provides control over network settings, including security groups and network ACLs.
Customization: Allows you to customize IP address ranges, create subnets, and configure route tables and gateways.
4. Managing Resources in Terraform
Yes, I have managed resources in Terraform. This includes creating and managing EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, security groups, RDS instances, IAM roles, and more using Terraform scripts.

5. Monitoring EC2 Instances
CloudWatch: Use CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance metrics such as CPU usage, disk I/O, and network activity.
CloudWatch Alarms: Set up alarms to get notified when specific metrics reach certain thresholds.
CloudWatch Logs: Collect and analyze log data from your EC2 instances.
Custom Metrics: Publish custom metrics to CloudWatch for application-specific monitoring.
6. Setting Up a Highly Available Web Application in AWS
EC2 Instances: Deploy EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Use ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in different AZs.
Auto Scaling: Configure Auto Scaling to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
RDS Multi-AZ: Use RDS with Multi-AZ deployment for database high availability.
Route 53: Use Route 53 for DNS management and health checks to route traffic to healthy instances.
7. Setting Up a Continuous Delivery Pipeline in AWS
CodePipeline: Set up CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deploy phases.
Source Stage: Configure the source stage to pull code from a repository (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit).
Build Stage: Use CodeBuild to build the code, run tests, and create artifacts.
Deploy Stage: Use CodeDeploy or another deployment service to deploy the built artifacts to the target environment.
IAM Roles: Ensure proper IAM roles and policies are in place for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and other services to interact securely.
8. Shifting from Monolithic to Microservices with Kubernetes
Decomposition: Break down the monolithic application into smaller, loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality.
Containerization: Package each microservice into a container using Docker.
Kubernetes: Deploy and manage containers using Kubernetes.
Service Discovery: Use Kubernetes services for service discovery and load balancing.
Scaling: Use Kubernetes’ built-in scaling features to scale microservices based on demand.
CI/CD Integration: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
9. Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Modes
Single Instance: Deploys your application to a single Amazon EC2 instance. Suitable for development, testing, and low-traffic applications.
Load Balanced: Deploys your application to multiple Amazon EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancer. Suitable for production applications requiring high availability.
Rolling Updates: Updates a few instances at a time to minimize downtime.
Immutable Updates: Launches a new set of instances alongside the existing ones and switches traffic to the new instances when they pass health checks.
10. Passing Environment Variables in Kubernetes
ConfigMaps: Store configuration data in ConfigMaps and reference them in your pod specifications.
Secrets: Store sensitive data in Secrets and reference them in your pod specifications.
Pod Specification: Use the env or envFrom fields in the pod specification to pass environment variables.
11. Blue-Green Deployment Strategy on AWS
Two Environments: Create two identical environments: one active (blue) and one idle (green).
Route 53: Use Route 53 to route traffic to the blue environment.
Deployment: Deploy the new version to the green environment and test it thoroughly.
Switch Traffic: Once validated, switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment using Route 53.
Rollback: If any issues arise, switch traffic back to the blue environment.
